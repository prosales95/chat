# Chatting Application
=======

This repository contains a fairly simple chatting room for multiple users to join. It also has a menu toggle with some pages including a quotes list of successful people which you can then share on twitter after running the android emulator which enables the SocialSharing module to work properly
I am still in progress of developing it furtherly

### Getting the base project set up
!!The file quotes.json must be downloaded in your www folder 

First clone the project in your desired location.
Run the command `npm install` to install dependencies. After having Ionic all set up run `ionic serve` to launch the local server.
