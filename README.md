# Chatting Application
=======

This repository contains a fairly simple chatting room for multiple users to join. I am still in progress of developing it furtherly

### Getting the base project set up
First clone the project in your desired location.
Run the command `npm install` to install dependencies. After having Ionic all set up run `ionic serve` to launch the local server.
